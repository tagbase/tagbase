#summary A general introduction to taggging data

= For new users of electronic tagging ... =

Electronic tags, also referred to as data storage tags or biologgers, are miniaturized data loggers that provide measurement capabilities. Sizes of these tags have been dramatically reduced from the early days, when a tag resembled a backpack to nowadays where an implantable tag can be as tiny as a vitamin pill. The electronic components include a clock, a pressure (depth) sensor, a temperature sensor, and often a light level sensor. Salinity, fluorescence, pH and sonic measurements are available in some specialized studies ([http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a924373410~db=all Laidre et al. 2010]; [http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S099074400800003X Papastamatiou et al. 2007]; [http://www.springerlink.com/content/a524378202138363/abstract/ Meyers et al. 2010]). Additional sensors like accelerometer ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/h0m753m7581u113x/ Houghton et al. 2009]) and magnetometer ([http://www.star-oddi.com/resources/Files/Sturlaugsson-et-al-ICES-09_revised.pdf Sturlaugsson et al. 2009]) can further expand a tag's measuring capacity.

    _Tags used in studying marine animals. Clockwise from the top left: (a) conventional tags of various forms. The elongated plastic tags are often referred as spaghetti tags;(b) a pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT or PAT) attached on a striped marlin (red arrow); (c) a Lotek Wireless LAT-series archival tag; (d) surgical implanting of an archival tag in an albacore tuna. Note the sensor stalk protuding out from the fish on the top right; (e) a resting Southern elephant seal carrying a Argos satellite telemetry tag; and (f) an advanced archival tag package with accelerometer and digital camera mounted on the dorsal fin of a tiger shark.

Measurements are logged on solid-state memory on RAM with capacity of 16 to 128 MB, or on Flash cards with capacity over 1GB ([http://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2007/3/n003pp12.pdf Wilson et al. 2008]). Data can be sampled every second or fraction of second in high-frequency tags (e.g. daily diary tags; [http://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2007/3/n003pp12.pdf Wilson et al. 2008]). Realistically speaking, writing data at a frequency of 1 Hz or higher only allows for short-term deployments (< 1 month) and is geared towards studying detailed 3-dimensional movements such as body orientation during diving ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/x3310qvq5257610h/ Gleiss et al. 2009]; [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01801.x/abstract 2010]; [http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v10/p71-82/ Whitney et al. 2010]). For most pelagic fish species, data are usually logged every 30 seconds or 1-2 minutes, and any tag that samples at this rate will need to be physically recovered for complete data retrieval.

Standard button-size lithium batteries are usually used to power most tags for up to a designed 6 years of deployment, depending on sampling scheme. Solar panels are also added to some newer tags that theoretically can power a tag indefinitely, but practically serve as an option to extend battery life. The remaining design differences dichotomize into deployment platform, data recovery or transmission and tag retrieval mechanism
