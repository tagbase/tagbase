#summary A general introduction to taggging data

= For new users of electronic tagging ... =

  * Porting of the backend database to other enterprise type data management platforms beyond SQLserver, and in particular to the free, open source Postgre SQL system

  * Development of web interfaces for Tagbase for data importation and visualization, and allow controlled, brower-based access to Tagbase backend particularly useful for tag data management where multiple, distributed contributors involved (e.g. institutions, larger tagging projects)

  * Moving beyond centralized tag data systems to a more distributed architecture allowing integration of remote Tagbase servers and webservices
