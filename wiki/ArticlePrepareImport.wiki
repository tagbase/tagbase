#summary Preparation for importing tag data

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

Take some time to familiarize yourself with the operations of manufacturer software, as there are quite a few options to choose from. You should have a good understanding of the output formats and data in each file, and consult the corresponding documentation as they can be unintuitive in its naming or organization.

Note manufacturer may update their software frequently, and we can only support stable, public releases of those programs. 

= Essential information needed for import =

Before you import any files, make sure you have the following 

  # `TagCode` the serial code of your tag and has to be a unique. This unique code will allow us to distinguish a single tag from others.
  # `Date_Deploy` the date time of your deployment
  # `Date_Popoff` the date time of your tag recovery or pop-off
  # Tag setup or configuration file (e.g. a .htm file from Wildlife Computer Host program)

= Supported formats =

|| *Tag manufacturer* || *Tag types* || *Supported processed files from software* || *Abbreviation* ||
|| [http://www.lotek.com/downloads.htm Lotek Wireless] || Archival || Viewer2000, LAT `TagTalk`, LAT Viewer Studio || Lotek ||
|| [http://www.microwavetelemetry.com Microwave Telemetry]|| Popup archival / recovered popup || Reports (.xls) generated and delivered by manufacturer || MT ||
|| [http://www.wildlifecomputers.com/downloads.aspx Wildlife Computers] || Archival, popup archival, SPOT, Argos Fast-GPS || WC-AMP, !HexDecode, WC-DAP 2.0 & 3.0, GPE version 1 & 2 || WC ||
|| [http://www.desertstar.com/Products_category.aspx?intProductCategoryID=22 Desert Star Systems] || `SeaTag-MOD` || `SeaDock`, `SeaTrack` || DS ||

 * Support for importing Desert Star tags is limited, since we have not seen enough a variety of outputs from various users. Please contact us if you are interested.

=== Not supported yet: ===

 * Specialized, high-frequency sampling sensors for accelerometry, magnetometry, and velocity etc.

 _ We try our best to cover most tag file formats, but it is likely we can miss some of them. You would be amazed how many variations are possible even with a single tag model and a specific manufacturer software version. If you find specific formats that you would like to include or have troubles importing, leave us a comment or file an issue. _


= Formatting your tag files =

== PAT tag files (.xls) from WC and MT ==

 * Files should have been processed by the manufacturer software
 * No further preparation is necessary except your own quality control practices

== WC DAP Processor output files (.csv) for multiple tag types ==

 * Make sure you checked on this option - 
   {{{ 
     Save Stored Archive Data in CSV Files 
   }}}

Otherwise, any time series data won't be available in your output files

 * The default DAP processing does not provide any light-based geolocations, you will need to run the GPE software to get an updated `LightLoc.csv` file for each tag you process. Refer to [ArticleWcDap here] for more details.
 
== Archival tag files ==

|| *Configuration* || *File1 - time series* || *File2 - positions* ||
|| Lotek|| `TimeSeries.csv` or `Basic or 01 log` || `DateLog.csv` or `00 log` ||
|| Wildlife Computer || `.csv` from !HexDecode or Instrument Helper || `.xls` from TSP/GPE ||
|| Wildlife Computer DAP || `.csv` from DAP || saved `.csv` from GPE2 ||

  # Usually 2 files required for each tag
  # All files must have a header line (header line does not have to be the first line in the file, although recommended)

==== For Lotek Wireless (using Viewer2000 software) ===
   * File #1 is the time series file (e.g. `.BIN.TimeSeries.csv`)
   * File #2 is the day log file (e.g. `.BIN.DayLog.csv`) with location data

==== For Lotek Wireless (using LAT `TagTalk` software) ===
   * File #1 is the time series file (e.g. `Basic Log.csv`)
   * File #2 is the day log file (e.g. `Day Log.csv`) with location data
   * By default, Tagbase imports positions generated by threshold (TR) method, since there is no clear documentation on the different choices offered by template-fit (TF)
   * It is important to pay attention to the date format. Select `YYYY/MM/DD` from the menu: `Setup` > `Date Format Settings`

   * To obtain necessary files, click on `View Log`

http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/LatTagTalkViewLog.jpg

  * The screen below will appear once data is loaded.  Make sure to change `Record Time Adjustment` to `Greenwich Mean Time`, also set `Display of Scalable Measurements` to `Scaled Tag Measurements`. Then, click `Save all Logs` and wait while files are written!

==== For Wildlife Computers: ====
  * File #1 is the time series file (.csv), obtained from !HexDecode, Instrument Helper or DAP software 
  * What to turn OFF (uncheck) in !HexDecode:
        # Include rows with no sensor data
        # Hour Markers & Battery Voltages
        # Deployment/ Duty Cycle Markers 
        # Date Range (off by default)
  * While using (checked):
        # Titles of Fields in First Row
        # Date stamps as dd/mm/yyyy (default)
        # Time stamps as hh:mm:ss (default)
  * File #2 is the output file (.xls) with location data, obtained from WC-TSP or GPE software
  * For DAP, make sure you are running GPE2 to get File #2

== Desert Star `SeaTag-MOD` files ==

The following files can be imported for each `SeaTag`:

  * Data logged file (.csv) downloaded by `SeaWatch` and processed by `SeaDock` (archival data share the same file format)
  * Setup log (.txt) from `SeaDock`
  * Geolocation data file (.txt) from `SeaTrack`
