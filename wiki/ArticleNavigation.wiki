#summary Getting around with the Form Navigation Tool

This tool is opened by default when you start Tagbase. It allows you to sub-select the operations you want to do (e.g. import or export), and takes you to the right place to carry out the operation.

Read the descriptions on the form to help to move around in Tagbase.

If you have closed this tool and want to bring it up again, you can simply find it in `Forms` > `NavigateForms`
