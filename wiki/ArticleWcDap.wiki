#summary Working with Wildlife Computer DAP and GPE software

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This page shares some of our experiences in working with the software suite of [http://www.wildlifecomputers.com/downloads.aspx Wildlife Computers], and namely DAP and GPE. This only serves as an practical guide to using their software, so you should refer to their documentation or customer service for detailed operations. You should also understand that manufacturers like Wildlife Computers has a rapid update/ release cycle on their software, and it is likely we lag behind in catching up with all their changes. We encourage you leaving us wiki comments at this page to help improve our collective experience in working with the software. Lastly, we are not advocating for any tag manufacturers, but rather we have yet to explore the many other options/ software, most of which are not free or easily accessible over the web.

== Mixed processing of tags/ decoding of Argos messages ==

DAP allows simple drag-and-drop operation of any number of Argos messages (DS files in the form of .txt), Wildlife Computer binary files (.wch), and tag setup files (.htm) from Windows Explorer. One approach to data processing involves saving Argos messages into a folder, and dragging that entire folder to DAP. If you want to apply a filter, via specific PTT IDs (Argos platform transmitter IDs), you will need to click on "Filter" and fill out a form *before* you drag-and-drop.

"Export Decoded Data" in the "File" menu will allow you to export all the data from multiple tag into a single set of .csv files. This set will be used as inputs for import into Tagbase. Note at this stage, no geolocations are available.

If you open any one of the many .csv files, you will find "DeployID" and it is essentially the PTT IDs. In the absence of a PTT ID for an archival tag, the tag serial number is used for both "DeployID" and "PTT" data columns. 

== Obtaining manufacturer light-based geolocation estimates via GPE ==

  * Start "Global Position Estimator" from your Start Menu (under Wildlife Computers), drag-and-drop a "LightLoc.csv" file or a previously processed GPE binary file (.wcg2).

  * or invoke it through the menu bar of DAP Processor (Tag > Light Level Global Position Estimator).

  * Select a tag to process or wait until automated processing is completed. Make adjustments where appropriate (you will have to consult Wildlife Computers documentation/ customer service for assistance).
  
  * Save the results, "File" > "Save" as a .wcg2 file to your preferred location

  * Export the results back to a "LightLoc.csv".

  * If you decide to run any Kalman filter/ Trackit analysis, proceed to do so, and save & export after that. The Kalman filter/ Trackit analysis is powered by open-source libraries authored by Anders Nielsen, Chi Hin Lam and John Sibert, and provided by the [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PFRP/ Pelagic Fisheries Research Program]. We recommend the following papers and references therein for a more complete understanding of the methods and assumptions needed to best utilize this type of analysis.

== Importing multiple tags from DAP into Tagbase ==

  * "DeployID" in a DAP .csv file will match up with `TagPTTID` in a batch import job file (e.g _!TagbaseBatchJob.xls_) to establish a link between the data in a DAP .csv file and the information provided in the job file.
  
  * Therefore, as mentioned above, for an archival tag, you should enter the tag serial number in both `TagCode` and `TagPTTID`.
