= Tagbase Plugins =

== Plugins are _OPTIONAL_. The core functions of Tagbase will work without any of them ==

If you decide to bypass the plugins, refer to [ArticleMissingRefs here] to remove the missing references from the database, which are the following:

   * `MapWinGIS` Components
   * Microsoft Internet Transfer Control 6.0 (SP4)

=== A zip file containing all required plugins is available [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/files/plugins.zip here]. ===


== 1. `wget.exe` == 
==== http://www.gnu.org/software/wget ====
==== http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget ====
==== Purpose - Download files across the Internet ====

Move/Copy to location - `C:\Windows`

== 2. `MapWinGis ActiveX control` ==
==== http://mapwingis.codeplex.com/releases/view/70023 ====
==== Purpose - Mapping functions ====

We currently only support `MapWinGis 4.7`. The newer versions involve code changes to some of `MapWinGis` fundamental functions, which we do not plan to support in the recent future.

There are two ways you can install:

  * *1. [http://mapwingis.codeplex.com/releases/view/70023 Use the installer]*

{{{ 
Which installer to use?

  * MapWinGIS47SRa-x86-Setup.exe - For Microsoft Office 2000, 2003, 2007, and 2010 (32-bit)
  
  * MapWinGIS447SRa-x64-Setup.exe - For Microsoft Office 2010 (64-bit) only
}}}

  * 2. Or, follow instructions below if you download our [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/files/plugins.zip zip] file posted above

  * Step A: Unzip `MapWinGIS47SRa-x86.zip` into `C:\MapWindow`

  * Step B: Go to "Start" menu and hit "Run" to run command prompt, execute the following line,

   {{{regsvr32.exe "C:\MapWindow\MapWinGIS.ocx"}}}

   A "success" message should be returned.
   
If Step B failed: install the Microsoft C++ 2008 runtime library first, [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&displaylang=en vcredist_x86_2008.exe] and repeat Step B.

For a Windows 7 (64-bit) system, your steps are as follows:
  * Step B: Go to "Start" menu and type "cmd" in the "Search programs and files" Instant Search Box.
  
  * Step C: Run command prompt as "Administrator" by clicking CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER (instead of just ENTER)

  * Step D: Change directory to the following folder, by typing
  
  {{{cd \windows\syswow64}}}
  
  * Step E: Register the control the same way as above
  
  {{{regsvr32.exe "C:\MapWindow\MapWinGIS.ocx"}}}

== 3. `XtrFun.dll` == 
==== http://www.xlxtrfun.com/XlXtrFun/XlXtrFun.htm ====
==== Purpose - Curve-fitting, interpolation of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional data ====

Move/Copy to location - `C:\Windows\System32`

{{{ 
Bug -
If you have a Office 2010 64-bit installed  (the default installation 
of Office 2010 is a 32-bit), this DLL will not work. But this will only 
affect interpolation features used in the forms, 
Plot_WC_SolarTimesInterpolated and 
MapWindow (when "Interpolate missing days" box is checked). 
We are trying to look for an alternative.

== 4. `MSINET.OCX` ==
=== _(No longer needed in Tagbase 4.9 or later)_ ===
==== http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/files/MSINET.zip ====
==== Purpose - Microsoft Internet transfer protocol and ActiveX control ====

Move/Copy to location - `C:\WINDOWS\system32`
