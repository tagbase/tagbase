  * Close the Microsoft Visual Basic window and click `OK` when prompted to stop the debugger
  * Click `Halt` to stop the code
  * Click once again on the splash screen to close it and begin the following fix

This happens when
  #  plugins are not correctly installed, or
  #  you are switching from working on a more recent version of MS Office to working in an older version of MS Office.

= Plugins =

Refer to [HowToInstallPlugins Plugins Installation] to check you have correctly installed all plugins

= Switching from new to old versions of MS Office =

# Press ALT+F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor. Or navigate from the menu: `Tools` > `Macros` > `Visual Basic Editor`

# In the new window, `Microsoft Visual Basic - Missing References`, go to `Tool` > `References`

# You should see something like:

  {{{ MISSING: Microsoft Excel Object Library 10.0 }}}

# Uncheck the missing reference, and replace with (tick) the correct reference from the list (scroll).

Click `OK` and you are done!

If you can't find a replacement, it is likely you don't have the plugins installed correctly.
