== 5 steps to import tag data: ==

  # Set up a batch job file from the Excel template, _!TagBaseBatchJob.xlt_
  # Put the batch job file into the folder where your tag data files are
  # Start *Tagbase*
  # Set up binning schemes (only for WC PAT tags)
  # Import via _!Batch_Import_TagData_ form

== A fish or an animal  ==

In Tagbase, we take an individual organism as our basis for an operation unit. Although we should use a more generic term like organism or release, we allow ourselves to be marine- and fish- centric, and refer any single unit as a *Fish*. 

Of course, we do love our birds, turtles, jellyfish, and yes, whales and dolphins.

== For the impatient ones, a quick guide to Tagbase import ==

= Step 1 - Setting up the batch job file from the Excel template =

{{{ 
Tips -
You can modify a copy of the template from the sample dataset 
or locate and click on the TagBaseBatchJob.xlt in the <templates> folder

=== General outline ===

Each row of data corresponds to a single tag output file. You can have 2 or more rows of data for an archival tag or for a double-tagged fish. All essential and required fields must be present for each row of data. 

For each tag you import, make sure you have the following Essential fields (5, Yellow): `IndivID`, `Filename`, `TagCode`, `TagPTTID`, `TagManufacturer`

=== Essential fields ===

  * `IndivID` - This number denotes how many individual fish (or animal) you are trying to import. If you have data for 10 fish, this !`IndivID` should start from 1 for the first fish, then increment by one all the way to 10 for each of the remaining fish. The same !`IndivID` number can be used for the same fish that carries multiple tags or has data from two or more output files.

  * `Filename` - This is the filename of the file you are importing. Include the file extension (.csv or .xls). The file directory path (e.g. <C:\Data\...>) is necessary if the batch job file does not sit in the same directory as your data files you want to import.

{{{ 
Tips -
For Wildlife Computer DAP (.csv) output files, you can use the wildcard character (star or asterisk or *) in a single entry to denote all files beginning with the same prefix. See an example [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/ImportJob2.jpg here].
}}}

  * `TagCode` - This is the serial code of your tag and has to be a unique. Use the same !`TagCode` for archival tags where there are two output files for each tag.

  * `TagPTTID` - This can be the PTT code you use for Argos transmission, or a label of your own.

!`TagManufacturer` - This denotes the type of data to import, it must be from one of these 4 options: WC or Wildlife Computers, MT or Microwave Telemetry, Archival, SPOT.

=== Additional required fields ===
==== for Archival tags (6, Turquoise) ====
 * !DateTime_Deploy 
 * !DateTime_Popoff 
 * !Lat_Deploy 
 * !Lon_Deploy
 * !Lat_Popoff
 * !Lon_Popoff

==== Wildlife Computers PAT tags (3, Orange)====

  * !`BinSampleInterval` � This denotes in hours (e.g. 2, 6, 12 or 24), how frequent is your time-at-depth or time-at-temperature is being sampled

  * !`BinID_Depth` � the identifier (any number < 100) that corresponds to a particular binning scheme, `BinID`, having been set in !*`WC_BinInfo`* table (see Step 3)

  * !`BinID_Temperature` � the identifier (any number >= 100) that corresponds to a particular binning scheme, `BinID`, having been set in !*`WC_BinInfo`* table (see Step 3)

{{{ Tips -
When a setup/ configuration file is supplied (.htm), Tagbase will try to gather information for these three fields. Therefore you can leave them blank. See an example [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/ImportJob2.jpg here].
