= Introduction =

The easiest way to master Tagbase is learning-by-example. You can mimic the setup with our sample dataset, which can be *[http://tagbase.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/files/tagfiles.zip downloaded here]*.

We recommend having a dedicated folder for Tagbase in an easily accessible location, such as:

{{{ C:\Tagbase}}}

Once you are able to bring the sample dataset, or better yet your own data, it is a matter of using queries to interrogate the data, and playing around with the various pre-configured forms and controls.

Have fun!
