#summary Vision and Future Developments

= Tagbase priorities are... =

  # Porting of the backend database to other enterprise type data management platforms beyond SQLserver, and in particular to the free, open source Postgre SQL system

  # Development of web interfaces for Tagbase for data importation and visualization – allow controlled, brower-based access to Tagbase backend particularly useful for tag data management where multiple, distributed contributors involved (e.g. institutions, larger tagging projects)

  # Moving beyond centralized tag data systems to a more distributed architecture allowing integration of remote Tagbase servers and webservices

=  With tagbase.org we hope to =

  # Promote improves, standards-based tag data management and best practices

  # Provide a free and open toolset (Tagbase) for electronic tag data management and visualization useful to researchers

  # Serve as a forum for the tagging community (i.e. end-user researchers, tag manufacturers, tool developers) on matters pertaining to tag data management. More specifically, we seek to facilitates discussions on data management issues, requirements, standards development, and technical coordination.
