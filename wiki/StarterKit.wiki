= A Starter Guide to Using Tagbase =

We have created a set of simulated data to illustrate how you can utilize Tagbase for your research. Remember the data provided here is *NOT* real, so don't use it for any research/ analysis. Contact us if you want us to assist you in setting up a customized starter kit using your own data.

=== Step 1: Download the Starter Kit from our [http://code.google.com/p/tagbase/downloads/list Downloads] page ===

Or follow the link [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/files/starterkit.zip here]

=== Step 2: Download also the latest Tagbase release from our [http://code.google.com/p/tagbase/downloads/list Downloads] page ===

Or follow the link [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/files/Tagbase4-5.zip here]

=== Step 3: Unzip the files into your disk drive, e.g. C:\Tagbase ===

Make sure you have the following folders and file:
  * Images
  * plugins
  * Shapes
  * tagfiles
  * templates
  * Tagbase.mdb (with the version number in the file name)

=== Step 4: Know your data files - preparation for import ===

  * This example includes 1 recovered PAT tags and 1 transmitted PAT tags. 

  * The recovered PAT tag has two data streams - a) low resolution, transmitted data (`mytag1.xls`); b) high-resolution archival time series (`mytag1.csv` & `mytag1Archiv.xls`). 
  * Since we want to get data from both data streams (to compare what's lost in the satellite transmission), we will treat this recovered tag as 2 distinct tags belonging to the same fish. 
  * We do this by giving different serial number, or `TagCode` in Tagbase's terminology. Therefore, for the archival data stream, we give 06A9999 as the `TagCode`, and PAT06A9999 for that of the transmitted data stream.

  * The other tag is pretty straightforward, it's a transmitted PAT tag with a serial number or `TagCode` - ABC0719 (`mytag2.xls`).

  * You can refer to *[ArticlePrepareImport Preparing for import]* and *[ArticleWcDap Working with Wildlife Computers DAP/GPE]* for detailed descriptions on what tag output file formats are supported.

=== Step 5: Understand the batch job file (.xls) which tells Tagbase what you want to import ===

  * Browse to the following folder: *Tagbase* > *tagfiles* > *simulated*, and open our pre-prepared batch job file, `TagBaseBatchJob.xls`. 

  * Open it up and see if you can understand how each record is prepared. 

  * Use *[ArticleImport Importing data]* to help you. You can model your own batch job file using this as an example.

=== Step 6: Start Tagbase ===

Simply double-click on the `Tagbase.mdb` in `C:\Tagbase`

If you experience errors on startup, make sure you have installed all the plugins and have all the necessary references. See these topics for help:

  * *[HowToInstallPlugins Plugins Installation]*
  * *[ArticleMissingRefs Handling "Missing References" error]*

=== Step 7: Open the batch import form via the `Form Navigation Tool` ===

  * Select `Import` from the *Operation* pull-down list, then
  * Select `Batch_Import_TagData` from the *Form* pull-down list
  * Hit the *Go* button
  * See also *[ArticleNavigation The Form Navigation Tool]*

=== Step 8: Follow the 3-step instructions on the `Batch_Import_TagData` to guide your import. ===

1. Locate the batch job file using the standard Windows Browse-To dialog:
     `C:\Tagbase\tagfiles\simulated\TagBaseBatchJob.xls`

2. Inspect the records that are loaded

3. Click on a *Fish* button to import

When completed, a message like this will appear.

=== Step 9: Visualize the data using a plot form ===

  * Bring to the foreground, the `Form Navigation Tool` (reopen from `Forms > NavigateForms` if you have closed it)
  * Select `Plot` from the *Operation* pull-down list, then
  * Select `Plot_WC_BubbleFreqPDT` from the *Form* pull-down list
  * Read the *Form Description*
  * Hit the *Go* button
  * Select a tag to plot, use *[ArticleDisplay Display and Graphs]* to assist you using the form more effectively. 

=== Step 10: Interrogate the data using a simple query ===

  * You can start asking "questions" about your data by setting up a query.
  * Query allows you to pull out specific information by filtering or aggregating (e.g. average/ min/ max)
  * You can interrogate data from a table and/ an existing query
  * It is good time to familiarize yourself with the basic terminology of databases. Use *[ArticleTerms Abbreviations and Terminology]* to guide you
  * See *[ArticleTables Data tables and Relationships]* to understand the data architecture of Tagbase. This will help you find all the information you need to construct your queries
  * See *[ArticleQuery Querying data]* to start mastering your query techniques

=== Step 11: Export data from Tagbase ===
There are two ways to export:
   * Using the *[ArticleExport Export Form]*
   * Using *[ArticleExportNative native export capabilities of MS Access]*

=== Step 12: Import geolocation analysis results back into Tagbase ===
   * Tagging often requires geo-correction of estimated positions of a fish, this is usually done with anlaysis routines in software like *[http://www.r-project.org/ R]*, Matlab etc. One set of popular routines is the Kalman filtering packages in R of [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PFRP/reprints/lam_nielsen_sibert.pdf Ukfsst] and [http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v419/p71-84/ Trackit], developed by Anders Nielsen, Chi Hin Lam and John Sibert. 
   
   * Wildlife Computers software can also run Ukfsst and Trackit via the GPE2 software (even though the packages are not acknowledged to their original source). See *[ArticleWcDap Working with Wildlife Computers DAP/GPE]* for details. Tagbase will import any results that are saved back to a `-LightLoc.csv` file. 
   
   * We recommend using the *R* implementation where possible, since it is more flexible in terms of getting diagnostics of results and extracting data streams. 
   
   * We also recommend you obtain a good understanding of any geolocation routines, since each of them does have assumptions and caution is needed to correctly intrepret the results. While being able to run geolocation correction with manufactuer software confers convenience, we may become careless in regarding geolocation routines as a push-button operation that requires no evaluation. 
   
   * Refer to *[ArticleGeolocate Running and importing a geolocation analysis]* for a simplified run conducting geolocation analysis with Trackit and importing the results back to Tagbase.
 
=== Step 13: Interact with track and tag data on a map ===

   * You can interact with your tag data whenever you have track data.
   
   * With *[ArticleMap Integrated Mapping]* in Tagbase, you can extract and visualize data based on 1 or multiple positions.
   
   * Satellite imagery snapshots can also be downloaded across the web, on the fly to be viewed along with your data
