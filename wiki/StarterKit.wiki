= A Starter Guide to Using Tagbase =

We have created a set of simulated data to illustrate how you can utilize Tagbase for your research. Remember the data provided here is *NOT* real, so don't use it for any research/ analysis. Contact us if you want us to assist you in setting up a customized starter kit using your own data.

=== Step 1: Download the Starter Kit from our [http://code.google.com/p/tagbase/downloads/list Downloads] page ===

Or follow the link [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/files/starterkit.zip here]

=== Step 2: Download also the latest Tagbase release from our [http://code.google.com/p/tagbase/downloads/list Downloads] page ===

Or follow the link [http://tagbase.googlecode.com/files/Tagbase4-5.zip here]

=== Step 3: Unzip the files into your disk drive, e.g. C:\Tagbase ===

Make sure you have the following folders and file:
  * Images
  * plugins
  * Shapes
  * tagfiles
  * templates
  * Tagbase.mdb (with the version number in the file name)

=== Step 4: Know your data files - preparation for import ===

  * This example includes 1 recovered PAT tags and 1 transmitted PAT tags. 

  * The recovered PAT tag has two data streams - a) low resolution, transmitted data (`mytag1.xls`); b) high-resolution archival time series (`mytag1.csv` & `mytag1Archiv.xls`). 
  * Since we want to get data from both data streams (to compare what's lost in the satellite transmission), we will treat this recovered tag as 2 distinct tags belonging to the same fish. 
  * We do this by giving different serial number, or `TagCode` in Tagbase's terminology. Therefore, for the archival data stream, we give 06A9999 as the `TagCode`, and PAT06A9999 for the transmitted data stream.

  * The other tag is pretty straightforward, it's a transmitted PAT tag with a serial number or `TagCode` ABC0719 (`mytag2.xls`).

  * You can refer to *[ArticlePrepareImport Preparing for import]* and *[ArticleWcDap Working with Wildlife Computers DAP/GPE]* for detailed descriptions on what tag output file formats are supported.

=== Step 5: Understand the batch job file (.xls) which tells Tagbase what you want to import ===

  * Browse to the following folder: *Tagbase* > *tagfiles* > *simulated*, and open our pre-prepared batch job file, `TagBaseBatchJob.xls`. 

  * Open it up and see if you can understand how each record is prepared. 

  * Use *[ArticleImport Importing data]* to help you. You can model your own batch job file using this as an example.

=== Step 6: Start up Tagbase ===

Simply double-click on the `Tagbase.mdb` in `C:\Tagbase`

If you experience errors on startup, make sure you have installed all the plugins and have all the necessary references. See these topics for help:

  * [HowToInstallPlugins Plugins Installation]
  * [ArticleMissingRefs Handling "Missing References" error]

=== Step 7: Open the batch import form via the `Form Navigation Tool` ===

  * Select `Import` from the *Operation* pull-down list, then
  * Select `Batch_Import_TagData` from the *Form* pull-down list
  * Hit the *Go* button
  * See also [ArticleNavigation The Form Navigation Tool]

=== Step 8: Follow the 3-step instructions on the `Batch_Import_TagData` to guide your import. ===

1. Locate the batch job file using the standard Windows Browse-To dialog:
     `C:\Tagbase\tagfiles\simulated\TagBaseBatchJob.xls`

2. Inspect the records that are loaded

3. Click on a *Fish* button to import

When completed, a message like this will appear.

=== Step 9: Visualize the data using a plot form ===

  * Bring to the foreground, the `Form Navigation Tool` (reopen from `Forms > NavigateForms` if you have closed it)
  * Select `Plot` from the *Operation* pull-down list, then
  * Select `Plot_WC_BubbleFreqPDT` from the *Form* pull-down list
  * Read the *Form Description*
  * Hit the *Go* button
  * Select a tag to plot, use *[ArticleDisplay Display and Graphs]* to assist you using the form more effectively. 

=== Step 10: Interrogate the data using a simple query ===
=== Step 11: Export data from Tagbase ===
There are two ways to export
   * Using the *[ArticleExport Export Form]*
   * Using native export capabilities of MS Access

=== Step 12: Import geolocation analysis results back into Tagbase ===
   * Refer to here for details conducting geolocation analysis with Trackit
   * Macro

=== Step 13: Interact with track and tag data on a map ===
