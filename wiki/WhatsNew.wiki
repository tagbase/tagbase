#summary Announcements of the latest project features

Welcome to the What's New page for Project Tagbase. Here you'll find descriptions of our latest and exciting improvements.

= November 2011 =

== Tagbase 4.7 is released ==

We put in quite a bit of work to improve import support for Microwave Telemetry (MT) tags. Plus, this version features a new plotting form for MT data, which includes coloring of depth time series by corresponding temperature values. 

MapWindow now also supports display of polygons, which can be constructed based on your start/end and preliminary track positions. You can use these polygons to subset and access your tag data!

== All-new Help articles ==

We have largely expanded our help topics. Hopefully you will find them useful and make your usage experience of Tagbase better. Suggest topics that you want to see us cover too. 

== Tagbase 4.6 is released ==

We try to keep up with some software updates of Wildlife Computers DAP and GPE. This release supports multiple tag import from one single set of Wildlife Computer output files.

== Give our Starter kit a try ==

We try to get you test-drive Tagbase by providing a *StarterKit* going over key functionalities that you can utilize.

== New contributors ==

We warmly welcome our colleagues, Ben Galaurdi of [http://www.tunalab.org/ Pelagics Research Center (UMass Amherst)] and Tim Sippel of [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/PFRP/ Pelagics Fisheries Research Program] (U Hawaii)/ NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center as contributors to our project.
