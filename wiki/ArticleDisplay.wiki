= Introduction =

The Display/Plot forms have pre-set graphs that plot your tag data. A variety of plot forms, along with a specified description of what are being plotted, are accessible through the [ArticleNavigation Form Navigation Tool] > *Plot*. Examples of these plots include:

  # XY/Time Series
  # Histogram
  # Bubble Plots

= Our recommendations =

  # Plot forms are accessible through the [ArticleNavigation Form Navigation Tool] or under *`Forms`* in Access
  # Read the description of a form on the [ArticleNavigation Form Navigation Tool] to get an idea of what a form does for you
  # Just play around with the forms! Or make new ones on your own, using existing ones as examples if needed.

= Usage tips on using Plot forms =

 * When you open a form and MS Access displays the following error message `An error occurred while sending data to the OLE server (the application used to create the object`. Just click *OK*. Nothing has gone wrong; it is just a little glitch in Access.

  * Go through the selection items in the direction from *left* to *right* and click the *Plot* button

  * If you hit the *Plot* button without making any selections on `Date/Time Range`, Tagbase will try plot all the time points.
 
  * To see the plotted data in a spreadsheet view, double-click anywhere on a graph.
  
  You can copy the data table to clipboard and paste it in Excel or other software.

 * To modify the graph properties, right-click anywhere on a graph, and select from the pop-up menu. Graph properties are similar to those in Excel.
