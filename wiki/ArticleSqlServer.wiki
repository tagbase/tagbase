For the Express version, we recommend installing the "Database and Management Tools" option, which is the default on their website.

= Troubleshoot =

 * Depending on your Windows operating systems, you might have difficulty in *`Attach`* the `Tagbase.mdf` and `Tagbase_log.ldf` files in the SQL Server Management Studio, due to permission issues. 
 * When that happens, you can copy these two files into the data folder of the SQL server data directory, such as:
   `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA`
 * *Tagbase* will now show up in the `ObjectExplorer` as `Read-Only`
 * Right-click on it, select `Properties` > `Options` > scroll down to `State` 
 * Set "_False_" to the option `Database Read-Only`
 * For more information on SQL Server Management Studio, find out [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174173.aspx here]
